        <h1>My Goals</h1>
        <p>Right now my main goal is to focus on my studies. I am majoring in Information Technology and took this class because it seemed interesting and relevent. Coding websites is pretty different from other forms of coding I have tried an appeals to me in unique ways. The thing I like about IT is how vast it is and how there is always something new to learn and test out.</p>
